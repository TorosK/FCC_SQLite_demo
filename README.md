# FCC_SQLite_demo

A reminder / to-do app developed as part of my internship with ICA Gruppen.

Original idea was for grocery store workers to have an app on their smartphones to help organize shelves, placement and in particular to set reminders for consumable items taking in consideration their respective shelf-lives, so that they can easily refer to the app to see when to take care of products that are expiring or have expired and where in the store that particular item is places, amounts etc.
Basically a reminder app to help store manage expirable items and to reduce waste.

-Android Studio

-Java

-The app uses SQLite as Database.

-ZXing Camera Scan Barcode QR-code function is incorporated into app.
